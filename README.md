bookmarks-manager-extension
===========================


Bookmarks Manager adds the most important bookmark functionality to Opera 15, allowing importing bookmarks exported from Opera 12.

# Set up # 

1) Export your bookmarks from Opera 12 with Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks > File > Export as HTML. This saves them in the (defacto) standard that's also used by Safari, Firefix, Delicious and others.

2) Install and activate Bookmark Manager from the icon next to the address bar. Choose "Manage and Import" in the pop-up. Choose "Import bookmarks" and upload the file exported from Opera 12. 

# Manage bookmarks #

From the main bookmark manager screen, you can make new folders, delete bookmarks and move bookmarks from one folder to another. And, of course, you can go to a bookmarked page.

Advanced Options (below the list of bookmarks) allows deletion of all bookmarks (be careful!) and exporting as Netscape format.

# Bookmarking a page #

Clicking the Bookmark Manager icon next to the address bar offers a button "Bookmark this page". This is also available in the context menu on any page. Pages already bookmarked have a coloured icon.

# Coming soon #

A supplementary extension that adds a star icon inside the URL bar next to "Add to Speed Dial" and "Add to Stash" that adds one-click bookmarking.

# Credits #

This extension was made by Stuart Langridge (www.kryogenix.org) and is available on Github. Thanks to Mağruf Çolakoğlu for alpha testing, and generous people who allowed us to use their real bookmarks files for testing (given the format is so ill-documented).


TODO

- Move "Filter bookmarks" into pop-up; increase its function
- A supplementary extension to add one-click bookmarking inside the address bar. (Must be separate as Chrome extensions can't have both a page action and a browser action)
- right click, bookmark this link (for bookmarklets)
- show bookmarks in alphabetcal order
- undo on moves and deletes.
- remember open/closed status of folders in the popup
